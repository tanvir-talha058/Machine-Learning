However, tracking actors like this are crucial to preventing your enterprise from being hit with such an attack,\\\" the researchers said.\\n\\\"The information ShinyHunters gathers is often turned around and sold on the same underground marketplaces where ransomware actors use it to launch their own attacks. If enterprises can move to detect activity like ShinyHunters, they in turn can stop ransomware attacks before they are ever launched.\\\"\\n\\n\",\n          \"Protection against insider risks works when the process involves controlling the data transfer channels or examining data sources.\\nOne approach involves preventing USB flash drives from being copied or sending them over email. The second one concerns preventing leakage or fraud in which an insider accesses files or databases with harmful intentions.\\nWhat's the best way to protect your data?\\nIt seems obvious that prevention is the best way to solve any problem. In most cases, DCAP (data-centric audit and protection) and DAM (database activity monitoring) is sufficient. Both serve the purpose of protecting data at rest.\\nThe following example illustrates the approach we found in the Russian legal system.\\nAn employee of the Federal Migration Service in one of the Russian regions was approached by his friend, who asked him to hide information about two offenses in his file in the migrant database. The employee knew that this could be done remotely, accessed the database from home, and blocked the necessary data. For doing this, he received a reward of a mere $100.\\nIn order to prevent this incident from happening, it was enough for the manager to observe the employee accessing the database and performing unauthorized operations. A DAM solution would be helpful. Here you can browse more information about the DAM system tactics.\\nAs an example of how the DCAP system detected fraud, here is a customer's case from SearchInform:\\nSearchInform FileAuditor identified several computers on which price lists were stored and where, in addition to selling prices, purchase prices were also listed. This information is confidential; it is prohibited to distribute it uncontrollably within or outside the company. If customers know the purchase prices, they will be armed with arguments and can negotiate the best discounts. There is clearly a loss for the seller.\\nThe price column was typed in white, which made the price list appear like it was normal. In spite of this, FileAuditor acknowledged that the purchase price was definitely included in the document. Investigating the case using the DLP system, the cybersecurity specialist discovered that employees had forwarded these price lists to external email addresses. A subsequent investigation confirmed that there was collusion between the buyers and sellers.\\nThis was classic scheming: the seller's manager agreed to a large discount for the buyer on any pretext he could think of. The buyer representative agreed to repay a portion of the difference to the seller's manager, who negotiated the discount.\\nSo, both the seller and manager benefited, while the company selling lost money. In the event of a violation, it can take up to a year for the damage to be identified; depending on the size of the business, this damage can range from thousands up to millions of dollars.\\nIt turns out that control of information sources enables an information security expert to detect an incident at its earliest stage - intention, rather than following up after it occurs. Tight control on such matters prohibits a more detailed investigation, which would allow evidence to be collected and conclusions drawn so that the incident wouldn't repeat itself. Here, the information security specialist has tightened DLP security policies on documents that include purchase prices.\\nWhich is the best approach to data protection?\\nA complex approach. It's not possible to solve everything with DLP. Not everything is really dependent on control of the source. However, when combined, these approaches give a super-effect. When the DCAP system detects a potential violation, the DLP system gathers evidence and allows conclusions to be drawn on how to improve business processes and make them more transparent.\\nWhat are DCAP and DAM?\\nDCAP and DAM solutions are already on the market in mass quantities due to the need for data at rest protection. In addition, this software is easy to use and integrates with already popular security solutions.\\nYou can use SearchInform FileAuditor to determine:\\nwhich documents contain business-critical information,\\nhow much of this information is stored by the company and where it is located,\\nwho has access to them and can modify them.\\nIt is possible for the IT department to take on such tasks. For instance, DCAP makes the file system less messy since each document is assigned a category (contracts, prices, personal data, research, etc.).\\n\\n\\nProbably not the most important feature, but shadow copying is a useful feature, which lets you restore documents without any problems if something goes wrong. As a first step, however, the software is intended for information security specialists.\\nHere's how FileAuditor works:\\nsearches for a file\\nassesses its compliance with the rules and labels it (\\\"personal data,\\\" \\\"agreement,\\\" etc.)\\nif necessary, copy a file to the repository.\\nkeeps track of all actions with files and folders\\nreads permissions on files and folders\\nat subsequent checks, only newly added or changed files are scanned.\\nThis year, SearchInform also released its own database monitoring solution - SearchInform Database Monitor. A database is the main information asset of businesses, so it plays a critical role in their operations. Fraudsters are interested in both the entire array and specific access points to data. This threat can be handled using the DAM system; for example, the Database Monitor sees:\\nWho is accessing the databases, and for what purpose?\\nWhat information is requested from the database, and how much of it.\\nWhat changes are being made to the databases?\\nIn spite of the belief by many companies that they have sufficient control over their file systems and are certain that their users will adhere to corporate policies, our experience shows that some companies can treat sensitive information poorly, and some documents can be found at nonconforming locations.\\nTry the file audit solution for 30 days for free, and you'll probably change your mind and learn more about data misuse incidents within your company.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Even as a massive data breach affecting Air India came to light the previous month, India's flag carrier airline appears to have suffered a separate cyber assault that lasted for a period of at least two months and 26 days, new research has revealed, which attributed the incident with moderate confidence to a Chinese nation-state threat actor called APT41.\\nGroup-IB dubbed the campaign \\\"ColunmTK\\\" based on the names of command-and-control (C2) server domains that were used for facilitating communications with the compromised systems.\\n\\\"The potential ramifications of this incident for the entire airline industry and carriers that might yet discover traces of ColunmTK in their networks are significant,\\\" the Singapore-headquartered threat hunting company said.\\nWhile Group-IB alluded that this may have been a supply chain attack targeting SITA, the Swiss aviation information technology company told The Hacker News that they are two different security incidents.\\n\\\"The airline confirmed vis-\\u00e0-vis SITA on June 11, 2021 that the cyber attack on Air India [...] is not the same or in any way linked to the attack on SITA PSS,\\\" SITA told our publication over email.\\nAlso known by other monikers such as Winnti Umbrella, Axiom and Barium, APT41 is a prolific Chinese-speaking nation-state advanced persistent threat known for its campaigns centered around information theft and espionage against healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications sectors to establish and maintain strategic access for stealing intellectual property and committing financially motivated cybercrimes.\\n\\\"Their cyber crime intrusions are most apparent among video game industry targeting, including the manipulation of virtual currencies, and attempted deployment of ransomware,\\\" according to FireEye. \\\"APT41 operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance.\\\"\\nOn May 21, Air India disclosed a data breach affecting 4.5 million of its customers over a period stretching nearly 10 years in the wake of a supply chain attack directed at its Passenger Service System (PSS) provider SITA earlier this February.\\nThe breach involved personal data registered between Aug. 26, 2011, and Feb. 3, 2021, including details such as names, dates of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance, and Air India frequent flyer data, as well as credit card data.\\nFireEye's Mandiant, which is assisting SITA with the incident response efforts, has since determined that the attack was highly sophisticated and that the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and compromise indicators point to a single entity, adding the \\\"identity and motive of the perpetrator are not entirely conclusive.\\\"\\nLikely a New Attack Against Air India\\nGroup-IB's analysis has now revealed that at least since Feb. 23, an infected device inside Air India's network (named \\\"SITASERVER4\\\") communicated with a server hosting Cobalt Strike payloads dating all the way back to Dec. 11, 2020.\\nFollowing this initial compromise, the attackers are said to have established persistence and obtained passwords in order to pivot laterally to the broader network with the goal of gathering information inside the local network.\\nNo fewer than 20 devices were infected during the course of lateral movement, the company said. \\\"The attackers exfiltrated NTLM hashes and plain-text passwords from local workstations using hashdump and mimikatz,\\\" Group-IB Threat Intelligence Analyst, Nikita Rostovcev, said. \\\"The attackers tried to escalate local privileges with the help of BadPotato malware.\\\"\\nIn all, the adversary extracted 23.33 MB of data from five devices named SITASERVER4, AILCCUALHSV001, AILDELCCPOSCE01, AILDELCCPDB01, and WEBSERVER3, with the attackers taking 24 hours and 5 minutes to spread Cobalt Strike beacons to other devices in the airline's network. The initial entry point for the attack remains unknown as yet.\\nConnections to Barium are grounded on the basis of overlaps between the C2 servers found in the attack infrastructure with those used in earlier attacks and tactics employed by the threat actor to park their domains once their operations are over. Group-IB also said it discovered a file named \\\"Install.bat\\\" that bore similarities to payloads deployed in a 2020 global intrusion campaign.\\nWhen reached for a response, Group-IB CTO Dmitry Volkov told The Hacker News that \\\"Despite the fact that the initial compromise vector remains unknown, Group-IB treats [the] SITA incident and Air India breach as interrelated.\\\"\\n\\\"This assumption is built on the fact that it was a server in Air India's network that, Group-IB assumes, might have established [a] connection with SITA's network that was breached first. According to Group-IB's data, SITASERVER4 was the first host to have been infected within Air India's network. This has also been confirmed by Air India,\\\" Volkov added.\\nHowever, it's worth noting that SITASERVER4 was neither owned or managed by SITA. Speaking on background, SITA noted that the server in question had been previously used to host software offered by the company to Air India and that the specific software was removed from the server in 2019.\\nThe aviation IT provider also clarified that none of the methods that were used to target Air India since February 23 were put to use in the attacks on SITA PSS, adding the adversary was removed from its network weeks prior to the start of the malicious activity directed against the airline, implying that the two incidents had no bearing on one another.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Data_Breaches\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

However, tracking actors like this are crucial to preventing your enterprise from being hit with such an attack,\\\" the researchers said.\\n\\\"The information ShinyHunters gathers is often turned around and sold on the same underground marketplaces where ransomware actors use it to launch their own attacks. If enterprises can move to detect activity like ShinyHunters, they in turn can stop ransomware attacks before they are ever launched.\\\"\\n\\n\",\n          \"Protection against insider risks works when the process involves controlling the data transfer channels or examining data sources.\\nOne approach involves preventing USB flash drives from being copied or sending them over email. The second one concerns preventing leakage or fraud in which an insider accesses files or databases with harmful intentions.\\nWhat's the best way to protect your data?\\nIt seems obvious that prevention is the best way to solve any problem. In most cases, DCAP (data-centric audit and protection) and DAM (database activity monitoring) is sufficient. Both serve the purpose of protecting data at rest.\\nThe following example illustrates the approach we found in the Russian legal system.\\nAn employee of the Federal Migration Service in one of the Russian regions was approached by his friend, who asked him to hide information about two offenses in his file in the migrant database. The employee knew that this could be done remotely, accessed the database from home, and blocked the necessary data. For doing this, he received a reward of a mere $100.\\nIn order to prevent this incident from happening, it was enough for the manager to observe the employee accessing the database and performing unauthorized operations. A DAM solution would be helpful. Here you can browse more information about the DAM system tactics.\\nAs an example of how the DCAP system detected fraud, here is a customer's case from SearchInform:\\nSearchInform FileAuditor identified several computers on which price lists were stored and where, in addition to selling prices, purchase prices were also listed. This information is confidential; it is prohibited to distribute it uncontrollably within or outside the company. If customers know the purchase prices, they will be armed with arguments and can negotiate the best discounts. There is clearly a loss for the seller.\\nThe price column was typed in white, which made the price list appear like it was normal. In spite of this, FileAuditor acknowledged that the purchase price was definitely included in the document. Investigating the case using the DLP system, the cybersecurity specialist discovered that employees had forwarded these price lists to external email addresses. A subsequent investigation confirmed that there was collusion between the buyers and sellers.\\nThis was classic scheming: the seller's manager agreed to a large discount for the buyer on any pretext he could think of. The buyer representative agreed to repay a portion of the difference to the seller's manager, who negotiated the discount.\\nSo, both the seller and manager benefited, while the company selling lost money. In the event of a violation, it can take up to a year for the damage to be identified; depending on the size of the business, this damage can range from thousands up to millions of dollars.\\nIt turns out that control of information sources enables an information security expert to detect an incident at its earliest stage - intention, rather than following up after it occurs. Tight control on such matters prohibits a more detailed investigation, which would allow evidence to be collected and conclusions drawn so that the incident wouldn't repeat itself. Here, the information security specialist has tightened DLP security policies on documents that include purchase prices.\\nWhich is the best approach to data protection?\\nA complex approach. It's not possible to solve everything with DLP. Not everything is really dependent on control of the source. However, when combined, these approaches give a super-effect. When the DCAP system detects a potential violation, the DLP system gathers evidence and allows conclusions to be drawn on how to improve business processes and make them more transparent.\\nWhat are DCAP and DAM?\\nDCAP and DAM solutions are already on the market in mass quantities due to the need for data at rest protection. In addition, this software is easy to use and integrates with already popular security solutions.\\nYou can use SearchInform FileAuditor to determine:\\nwhich documents contain business-critical information,\\nhow much of this information is stored by the company and where it is located,\\nwho has access to them and can modify them.\\nIt is possible for the IT department to take on such tasks. For instance, DCAP makes the file system less messy since each document is assigned a category (contracts, prices, personal data, research, etc.).\\n\\n\\nProbably not the most important feature, but shadow copying is a useful feature, which lets you restore documents without any problems if something goes wrong. As a first step, however, the software is intended for information security specialists.\\nHere's how FileAuditor works:\\nsearches for a file\\nassesses its compliance with the rules and labels it (\\\"personal data,\\\" \\\"agreement,\\\" etc.)\\nif necessary, copy a file to the repository.\\nkeeps track of all actions with files and folders\\nreads permissions on files and folders\\nat subsequent checks, only newly added or changed files are scanned.\\nThis year, SearchInform also released its own database monitoring solution - SearchInform Database Monitor. A database is the main information asset of businesses, so it plays a critical role in their operations. Fraudsters are interested in both the entire array and specific access points to data. This threat can be handled using the DAM system; for example, the Database Monitor sees:\\nWho is accessing the databases, and for what purpose?\\nWhat information is requested from the database, and how much of it.\\nWhat changes are being made to the databases?\\nIn spite of the belief by many companies that they have sufficient control over their file systems and are certain that their users will adhere to corporate policies, our experience shows that some companies can treat sensitive information poorly, and some documents can be found at nonconforming locations.\\nTry the file audit solution for 30 days for free, and you'll probably change your mind and learn more about data misuse incidents within your company.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Even as a massive data breach affecting Air India came to light the previous month, India's flag carrier airline appears to have suffered a separate cyber assault that lasted for a period of at least two months and 26 days, new research has revealed, which attributed the incident with moderate confidence to a Chinese nation-state threat actor called APT41.\\nGroup-IB dubbed the campaign \\\"ColunmTK\\\" based on the names of command-and-control (C2) server domains that were used for facilitating communications with the compromised systems.\\n\\\"The potential ramifications of this incident for the entire airline industry and carriers that might yet discover traces of ColunmTK in their networks are significant,\\\" the Singapore-headquartered threat hunting company said.\\nWhile Group-IB alluded that this may have been a supply chain attack targeting SITA, the Swiss aviation information technology company told The Hacker News that they are two different security incidents.\\n\\\"The airline confirmed vis-\\u00e0-vis SITA on June 11, 2021 that the cyber attack on Air India [...] is not the same or in any way linked to the attack on SITA PSS,\\\" SITA told our publication over email.\\nAlso known by other monikers such as Winnti Umbrella, Axiom and Barium, APT41 is a prolific Chinese-speaking nation-state advanced persistent threat known for its campaigns centered around information theft and espionage against healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications sectors to establish and maintain strategic access for stealing intellectual property and committing financially motivated cybercrimes.\\n\\\"Their cyber crime intrusions are most apparent among video game industry targeting, including the manipulation of virtual currencies, and attempted deployment of ransomware,\\\" according to FireEye. \\\"APT41 operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance.\\\"\\nOn May 21, Air India disclosed a data breach affecting 4.5 million of its customers over a period stretching nearly 10 years in the wake of a supply chain attack directed at its Passenger Service System (PSS) provider SITA earlier this February.\\nThe breach involved personal data registered between Aug. 26, 2011, and Feb. 3, 2021, including details such as names, dates of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance, and Air India frequent flyer data, as well as credit card data.\\nFireEye's Mandiant, which is assisting SITA with the incident response efforts, has since determined that the attack was highly sophisticated and that the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and compromise indicators point to a single entity, adding the \\\"identity and motive of the perpetrator are not entirely conclusive.\\\"\\nLikely a New Attack Against Air India\\nGroup-IB's analysis has now revealed that at least since Feb. 23, an infected device inside Air India's network (named \\\"SITASERVER4\\\") communicated with a server hosting Cobalt Strike payloads dating all the way back to Dec. 11, 2020.\\nFollowing this initial compromise, the attackers are said to have established persistence and obtained passwords in order to pivot laterally to the broader network with the goal of gathering information inside the local network.\\nNo fewer than 20 devices were infected during the course of lateral movement, the company said. \\\"The attackers exfiltrated NTLM hashes and plain-text passwords from local workstations using hashdump and mimikatz,\\\" Group-IB Threat Intelligence Analyst, Nikita Rostovcev, said. \\\"The attackers tried to escalate local privileges with the help of BadPotato malware.\\\"\\nIn all, the adversary extracted 23.33 MB of data from five devices named SITASERVER4, AILCCUALHSV001, AILDELCCPOSCE01, AILDELCCPDB01, and WEBSERVER3, with the attackers taking 24 hours and 5 minutes to spread Cobalt Strike beacons to other devices in the airline's network. The initial entry point for the attack remains unknown as yet.\\nConnections to Barium are grounded on the basis of overlaps between the C2 servers found in the attack infrastructure with those used in earlier attacks and tactics employed by the threat actor to park their domains once their operations are over. Group-IB also said it discovered a file named \\\"Install.bat\\\" that bore similarities to payloads deployed in a 2020 global intrusion campaign.\\nWhen reached for a response, Group-IB CTO Dmitry Volkov told The Hacker News that \\\"Despite the fact that the initial compromise vector remains unknown, Group-IB treats [the] SITA incident and Air India breach as interrelated.\\\"\\n\\\"This assumption is built on the fact that it was a server in Air India's network that, Group-IB assumes, might have established [a] connection with SITA's network that was breached first. According to Group-IB's data, SITASERVER4 was the first host to have been infected within Air India's network. This has also been confirmed by Air India,\\\" Volkov added.\\nHowever, it's worth noting that SITASERVER4 was neither owned or managed by SITA. Speaking on background, SITA noted that the server in question had been previously used to host software offered by the company to Air India and that the specific software was removed from the server in 2019.\\nThe aviation IT provider also clarified that none of the methods that were used to target Air India since February 23 were put to use in the attacks on SITA PSS, adding the adversary was removed from its network weeks prior to the start of the malicious activity directed against the airline, implying that the two incidents had no bearing on one another.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Data_Breaches\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Researchers Detail Modus Operandi of ShinyHunters Cyber Crime Group ShinyHunters, a notorious cybercriminal underground group that's been on a data breach spree since last year, has been observed searching companies' GitHub repository source code for vulnerabilities that can be abused to stage larger scale attacks, an analysis of the hackers' modus operandi has revealed.\\n\\\"Primarily operating on Raid Forums, the collective's moniker and motivation can partly be derived from their avatar on social media and other forums: a shiny Umbreon Pok\\u00e9mon,\\\" Intel 471 researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News. \\\"As Pok\\u00e9mon players hunt and collect \\\"shiny\\\" characters in the game, ShinyHunters collects and resells user data.\\\"\\nThe revelation comes as the average cost of a data breach rose from $3.86 million to $4.24 million, making it the highest average cost in 17 years, with compromised credentials responsible for 20% of the breaches reported by over 500 organizations.\\nSince rising to prominence in April 2020, ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for a string of data breaches, including Tokopedia, Wattpad, Pixlr, Bonobos, BigBasket, Mathway, Unacademy, MeetMindful, and Microsoft's GitHub account, among others.\\nAn assessment by Risk Based Security found that the threat actor has exposed a total of more than 1.12 million unique email addresses belonging to S&P 100 organizations, education, government and military entities as of late 2020.\\nLast week, the group began selling a database purportedly containing the personal information of 70 million AT&T customers for a starting price of $200,000, although the U.S. telecom provider has denied suffering a breach of its systems.\\nShinyHunters has a checkered history of compromising websites and developer repositories to steal credentials or API keys to a company's cloud services, which are subsequently abused to gain access to databases and gather sensitive information to be resold for profit or published for free on hacker forums.\\nThe adversary has also been observed targeting DevOps personnel or GitHub repositories in order to steal valid OAuth tokens, leveraging them to breach cloud infrastructure and bypass any two-factor authentication mechanisms.\\n\\\"ShinyHunters may not have as much notoriety as the ransomware groups that are currently causing havoc for enterprises all over the world.

If enterprises can move to detect activity like ShinyHunters, they in turn can stop ransomware attacks before they are ever launched.\\\"\\n\\n\",\n          \"Protection against insider risks works when the process involves controlling the data transfer channels or examining data sources.\\nOne approach involves preventing USB flash drives from being copied or sending them over email. The second one concerns preventing leakage or fraud in which an insider accesses files or databases with harmful intentions.\\nWhat's the best way to protect your data?\\nIt seems obvious that prevention is the best way to solve any problem. In most cases, DCAP (data-centric audit and protection) and DAM (database activity monitoring) is sufficient. Both serve the purpose of protecting data at rest.\\nThe following example illustrates the approach we found in the Russian legal system.\\nAn employee of the Federal Migration Service in one of the Russian regions was approached by his friend, who asked him to hide information about two offenses in his file in the migrant database. The employee knew that this could be done remotely, accessed the database from home, and blocked the necessary data. For doing this, he received a reward of a mere $100.\\nIn order to prevent this incident from happening, it was enough for the manager to observe the employee accessing the database and performing unauthorized operations. A DAM solution would be helpful. Here you can browse more information about the DAM system tactics.\\nAs an example of how the DCAP system detected fraud, here is a customer's case from SearchInform:\\nSearchInform FileAuditor identified several computers on which price lists were stored and where, in addition to selling prices, purchase prices were also listed. This information is confidential; it is prohibited to distribute it uncontrollably within or outside the company. If customers know the purchase prices, they will be armed with arguments and can negotiate the best discounts. There is clearly a loss for the seller.\\nThe price column was typed in white, which made the price list appear like it was normal. In spite of this, FileAuditor acknowledged that the purchase price was definitely included in the document. Investigating the case using the DLP system, the cybersecurity specialist discovered that employees had forwarded these price lists to external email addresses. A subsequent investigation confirmed that there was collusion between the buyers and sellers.\\nThis was classic scheming: the seller's manager agreed to a large discount for the buyer on any pretext he could think of. The buyer representative agreed to repay a portion of the difference to the seller's manager, who negotiated the discount.\\nSo, both the seller and manager benefited, while the company selling lost money. In the event of a violation, it can take up to a year for the damage to be identified; depending on the size of the business, this damage can range from thousands up to millions of dollars.\\nIt turns out that control of information sources enables an information security expert to detect an incident at its earliest stage - intention, rather than following up after it occurs. Tight control on such matters prohibits a more detailed investigation, which would allow evidence to be collected and conclusions drawn so that the incident wouldn't repeat itself. Here, the information security specialist has tightened DLP security policies on documents that include purchase prices.\\nWhich is the best approach to data protection?\\nA complex approach. It's not possible to solve everything with DLP. Not everything is really dependent on control of the source. However, when combined, these approaches give a super-effect. When the DCAP system detects a potential violation, the DLP system gathers evidence and allows conclusions to be drawn on how to improve business processes and make them more transparent.\\nWhat are DCAP and DAM?\\nDCAP and DAM solutions are already on the market in mass quantities due to the need for data at rest protection. In addition, this software is easy to use and integrates with already popular security solutions.\\nYou can use SearchInform FileAuditor to determine:\\nwhich documents contain business-critical information,\\nhow much of this information is stored by the company and where it is located,\\nwho has access to them and can modify them.\\nIt is possible for the IT department to take on such tasks. For instance, DCAP makes the file system less messy since each document is assigned a category (contracts, prices, personal data, research, etc.).\\n\\n\\nProbably not the most important feature, but shadow copying is a useful feature, which lets you restore documents without any problems if something goes wrong. As a first step, however, the software is intended for information security specialists.\\nHere's how FileAuditor works:\\nsearches for a file\\nassesses its compliance with the rules and labels it (\\\"personal data,\\\" \\\"agreement,\\\" etc.)\\nif necessary, copy a file to the repository.\\nkeeps track of all actions with files and folders\\nreads permissions on files and folders\\nat subsequent checks, only newly added or changed files are scanned.\\nThis year, SearchInform also released its own database monitoring solution - SearchInform Database Monitor. A database is the main information asset of businesses, so it plays a critical role in their operations. Fraudsters are interested in both the entire array and specific access points to data. This threat can be handled using the DAM system; for example, the Database Monitor sees:\\nWho is accessing the databases, and for what purpose?\\nWhat information is requested from the database, and how much of it.\\nWhat changes are being made to the databases?\\nIn spite of the belief by many companies that they have sufficient control over their file systems and are certain that their users will adhere to corporate policies, our experience shows that some companies can treat sensitive information poorly, and some documents can be found at nonconforming locations.\\nTry the file audit solution for 30 days for free, and you'll probably change your mind and learn more about data misuse incidents within your company.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Even as a massive data breach affecting Air India came to light the previous month, India's flag carrier airline appears to have suffered a separate cyber assault that lasted for a period of at least two months and 26 days, new research has revealed, which attributed the incident with moderate confidence to a Chinese nation-state threat actor called APT41.\\nGroup-IB dubbed the campaign \\\"ColunmTK\\\" based on the names of command-and-control (C2) server domains that were used for facilitating communications with the compromised systems.\\n\\\"The potential ramifications of this incident for the entire airline industry and carriers that might yet discover traces of ColunmTK in their networks are significant,\\\" the Singapore-headquartered threat hunting company said.\\nWhile Group-IB alluded that this may have been a supply chain attack targeting SITA, the Swiss aviation information technology company told The Hacker News that they are two different security incidents.\\n\\\"The airline confirmed vis-\\u00e0-vis SITA on June 11, 2021 that the cyber attack on Air India [...] is not the same or in any way linked to the attack on SITA PSS,\\\" SITA told our publication over email.\\nAlso known by other monikers such as Winnti Umbrella, Axiom and Barium, APT41 is a prolific Chinese-speaking nation-state advanced persistent threat known for its campaigns centered around information theft and espionage against healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications sectors to establish and maintain strategic access for stealing intellectual property and committing financially motivated cybercrimes.\\n\\\"Their cyber crime intrusions are most apparent among video game industry targeting, including the manipulation of virtual currencies, and attempted deployment of ransomware,\\\" according to FireEye. \\\"APT41 operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance.\\\"\\nOn May 21, Air India disclosed a data breach affecting 4.5 million of its customers over a period stretching nearly 10 years in the wake of a supply chain attack directed at its Passenger Service System (PSS) provider SITA earlier this February.\\nThe breach involved personal data registered between Aug. 26, 2011, and Feb. 3, 2021, including details such as names, dates of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance, and Air India frequent flyer data, as well as credit card data.\\nFireEye's Mandiant, which is assisting SITA with the incident response efforts, has since determined that the attack was highly sophisticated and that the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and compromise indicators point to a single entity, adding the \\\"identity and motive of the perpetrator are not entirely conclusive.\\\"\\nLikely a New Attack Against Air India\\nGroup-IB's analysis has now revealed that at least since Feb. 23, an infected device inside Air India's network (named \\\"SITASERVER4\\\") communicated with a server hosting Cobalt Strike payloads dating all the way back to Dec. 11, 2020.\\nFollowing this initial compromise, the attackers are said to have established persistence and obtained passwords in order to pivot laterally to the broader network with the goal of gathering information inside the local network.\\nNo fewer than 20 devices were infected during the course of lateral movement, the company said. \\\"The attackers exfiltrated NTLM hashes and plain-text passwords from local workstations using hashdump and mimikatz,\\\" Group-IB Threat Intelligence Analyst, Nikita Rostovcev, said. \\\"The attackers tried to escalate local privileges with the help of BadPotato malware.\\\"\\nIn all, the adversary extracted 23.33 MB of data from five devices named SITASERVER4, AILCCUALHSV001, AILDELCCPOSCE01, AILDELCCPDB01, and WEBSERVER3, with the attackers taking 24 hours and 5 minutes to spread Cobalt Strike beacons to other devices in the airline's network. The initial entry point for the attack remains unknown as yet.\\nConnections to Barium are grounded on the basis of overlaps between the C2 servers found in the attack infrastructure with those used in earlier attacks and tactics employed by the threat actor to park their domains once their operations are over. Group-IB also said it discovered a file named \\\"Install.bat\\\" that bore similarities to payloads deployed in a 2020 global intrusion campaign.\\nWhen reached for a response, Group-IB CTO Dmitry Volkov told The Hacker News that \\\"Despite the fact that the initial compromise vector remains unknown, Group-IB treats [the] SITA incident and Air India breach as interrelated.\\\"\\n\\\"This assumption is built on the fact that it was a server in Air India's network that, Group-IB assumes, might have established [a] connection with SITA's network that was breached first. According to Group-IB's data, SITASERVER4 was the first host to have been infected within Air India's network. This has also been confirmed by Air India,\\\" Volkov added.\\nHowever, it's worth noting that SITASERVER4 was neither owned or managed by SITA.
